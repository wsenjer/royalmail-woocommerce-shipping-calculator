Wrapping all composer vendor packages inside your own namespace. Intended for WordPress plugins.

## Why?

Because of the lack of dependency management in WordPress, if two plugins bundled conflicting versions of the same package, hard-to-reproduce bugs arise.
Monkey patching composer vendor packages, wrapping them inside your own namespace is a less-than-ideal solution to avoid such conflicts.

See:
- [A Narrative of Using Composer in a WordPress Plugin](https://wptavern.com/a-narrative-of-using-composer-in-a-wordpress-plugin)
- [A Warning About Using Composer With WordPress](https://wppusher.com/blog/a-warning-about-using-composer-with-wordpress/)

## Install

> If you want to hook Imposter into [composer command events](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#command-events), install [Imposter Plugin](https://github.com/TypistTech/imposter-plugin) instead.
> See: [How can I integrate Imposter with composer?](#how-can-i-integrate-imposter-with-composer)

Installation should be done via composer, details of how to install composer can be found at [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require typisttech/imposter
```

## Config

In your `composer.json`:

```json
"extra": {
    "imposter": {
        "namespace": "My\\App\\Vendor",
        "excludes": [
            "dummy/dummy-excluded"
        ]
    }
}
```

### extra.imposter.namespace

*Required* String

This is the namespace prefix to be added to vendor packages.

### extra.imposter.excludes

*Optional* Array of strings

Vendor packages which needs to be excluded from namespace prefixing.
All [composer-made packages](https://packagist.org/packages/composer/) are excluded by default.
Besides, anything under the `Composer` namespace will be excluded.

## Usage

After every `$ composer install` and `$ composer update`:

```php
<?php

use TypistTech\Imposter\ImposterFactory;

$imposter = ImposterFactory::forProject('/path/to/project/root');
$imposter->run();
```

The above snippet:
1. Look for `/path/to/project/root/composer.json`
1. Find out [vendor-dir](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#vendor-dir)
1. Find out all [required packages](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#require), including those required by dependencies
1. Find out all [autoload paths](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload) for all required packages
1. Prefix all namespaces with the imposter namespace defined in your `composer.json`

Before:
```php
<?php

namespace Dummy\File;

use AnotherDummy\{
    SubAnotherDummy, SubOtherDummy
};
use Composer;
use Composer\Plugin\PluginInterface;
use Dummy\SubOtherDummy;
use OtherDummy\SubOtherDummy;
use RuntimeException;
use \UnexpectedValueException;
use function OtherVendor\myFunc;
use const OtherVendor\MY_MAGIC_NUMBER;

$closure = function () use ($aaa) {
    // Just testing.
};

class DummyClass
{
    public function useClosure()
    {
        array_map(function () use ($xxx) {
            // Just testing.
        }, []);
    }
}

function dummyFunction(string $namespace = null, string $use = null): array
{
    if (! is_null($namespace) && $namespace === 'dummy string' && $use === 'dummy string') {
        // Just testing.
    }

    return [];
}

foreach ([] as $namespace => $prefix) {
    $aaaa = '{' . $namespace . '}' . $prefix;
}

/** Just a comment for testing $namespace transformation */
```

After:
```php
<?php

namespace MyPlugin\Vendor\Dummy\File;

use MyPlugin\Vendor\AnotherDummy\{
    SubAnotherDummy, SubOtherDummy
};
use Composer;
use Composer\Plugin\PluginInterface;
use MyPlugin\Vendor\Dummy\SubOtherDummy;
use MyPlugin\Vendor\OtherDummy\SubOtherDummy;
use RuntimeException;
use \UnexpectedValueException;
use function MyPlugin\Vendor\OtherVendor\myFunc;
use const MyPlugin\Vendor\OtherVendor\MY_MAGIC_NUMBER;

$closure = function () use ($aaa) {
    // Just testing.
};

class DummyClass
{
    public function useClosure()
    {
        array_map(function () use ($xxx) {
            // Just testing.
        }, []);
    }
}

function dummyFunction(string $namespace = null, string $use = null): array
{
    if (! is_null($namespace) && $namespace === 'dummy string' && $use === 'dummy string') {
        // Just testing.
    }

    return [];
}

foreach ([] as $namespace => $prefix) {
    $aaaa = '{' . $namespace . '}' . $prefix;
}

/** Just a comment for testing $namespace transformation */
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I integrate imposter with composer?

Use [Imposter Plugin](https://github.com/TypistTech/imposter-plugin) instead.
It hooks imposter into [composer command events](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#command-events).

### Does imposter support `PSR4`, `PSR0`, `Classmap` and `Files`?

Yes for all. PSR-4 and PSR-0 autoloading, classmap generation and files includes are supported.

### Can I exclude some of the packages from imposter?

Yes, see [`extra.imposter.excludes`](#extraimposterexcludes).
All [composer made packages](https://packagist.org/packages/composer/) are excluded by default.

### How about `require-dev` packages?

Imposter do nothing on `require-dev` packages because imposter is intended for avoiding production environment., not for development environment.

### How about PHP built-in classes?

Imposter skips classes that on global namespace, for example: `\ArrayObject`, `\RuntimeException`

### How about packages that don't use namespaces?

Not for now.
Tell me your idea by [opening an issue](https://github.com/TypistTech/imposter/issues/new).

### How about packages that use fully qualified name?

Not for now. We need a better regex(or something better than regex) in the [Transformer](src/Transformer.php) class.
Tell me your idea by [opening an issue](https://github.com/TypistTech/imposter/issues/new)

### Which composer versions are supported?

Both v1 and v2.

### Will you add support for older PHP versions?

Never! This plugin will only work on [actively supported PHP versions](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php).

Don't use it on **end of life** or **security fixes only** PHP versions.
