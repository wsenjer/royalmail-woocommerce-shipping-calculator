Wrapping all composer vendor packages inside your own namespace. Intended for WordPress plugins. Imposter Plugin is a composer plugin wrapper for [Imposter](https://github.com/TypistTech/imposter/).

## Why?

Because of the lack of dependency management in WordPress, if two plugins bundled conflicting versions of the same package, hard-to-reproduce bugs arise.
Monkey patching composer vendor packages, wrapping them inside your own namespace is a less-than-ideal solution to avoid such conflicts.

See:
- [A Narrative of Using Composer in a WordPress Plugin](https://wptavern.com/a-narrative-of-using-composer-in-a-wordpress-plugin)
- [A Warning About Using Composer With WordPress](https://wppusher.com/blog/a-warning-about-using-composer-with-wordpress/)

## Install

Installation should be done via composer, details of how to install composer can be found at [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/).

First, add Imposter configuration in your `composer.json`

```json
"extra": {
    "imposter": {
        "namespace": "My\\App\\Vendor",
        "excludes": [
            "dummy/dummy-excluded"
        ]
    }
}
```

Then, install via composer cli

```bash
composer require typisttech/imposter-plugin
```

See: [Imposter readme](https://github.com/Typisttech/imposter#config) for details.

## Usage

### Sit Back and Relax

Once installed, this plugin hooks into `composer install`, `composer update` and `composer dump-autoload`, automatically run [imposter](https://github.com/TypistTech/imposter/) for you.
Besides, imposter plugin autoloads all modified files as [classmap](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#classmap).

When those events triggered, this plugin:
1. looks for `/path/to/project/root/composer.json`
2. finds out [vendor-dir](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#vendor-dir)
3. finds out all [required packages](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#require), including those required by dependencies
4. finds out all [autoload paths](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload) for all required packages
5. prefixes all namespaces with the imposter-plugin namespace defined in your `composer.json`

Learn more on [imposter's readme](https://github.com/TypistTech/imposter#usage).
